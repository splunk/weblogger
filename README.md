# WebLogger

Splunk logging for the web.

## Core Features

- Sends events directly to Splunk from within the browser.
- Utilizes sendBeacon API for asynchronous event transmission.
- Supports ECMAScript Modules.
- Works with latest version of all major browsers and frameworks.
- Small package size, light on resources, and free of external dependences.

## Basic Usage

```js
import WebLogger from "@splunk/weblogger";

const logger = new WebLogger({
  origin: "https://my.splunk.instance.com:8088",
  token: "11111111-2222-3333-4444-555555555555",
});

logger.debug({ event: "time_to_first_paint", duration: 172 });
logger.info({ action: "user_logged_in", username: "bob" });
logger.warn({ type: "violation", reason: "setTimeout handler took 82ms" });
logger.error({ message: "timeout while waiting for fetch", url: "/api/items" });
```

## Doesn't [splunk-javascript-logging](https://github.com/splunk/splunk-javascript-logging) already do this?

Yes however there a few issues with this package.

- No official Splunk support.
- Not actively maintained.
